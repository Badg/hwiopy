hwiopy
======

Hardware IO in python, especially for SoCs, starting with Beaglebone Black.

Introduction
--------

First, sorry (seriously sorry) but for the time being, the documentation here is going to be narsty. Not *lacking*, but more of a "brain dump" than an explanation. So it may only be helpful to me. But, uh, better than nothing? Probably? I wish I had time (or the resources to hire someone to document my shit) but at this point I'm just stretched too thinly. Butter over too much bread and all that.

Git flow
------

This is nowhere near anything remotely resembling stability, so all work is currently being done on the develop branch.
